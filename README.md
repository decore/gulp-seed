## Neat gulp seed

![It's WTFPLv2](http://www.wtfpl.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/logo-220x1601.png)

### Status
A bit clumsy, some stuff may not work.

### Includes
 * Bower dependency management
 * Webpack
 * SVG rasterization for all densities
 * Can pack iconfonts from SVG images
 * Pack sprites with spritesmith
 * Webdriver.io with Mocha tests injection for the specific targets

There might be some branches with Angular, React + rx.js support.

Have fun.
